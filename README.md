We're designing Tessel Reach!

> Reach is a remote I/O board for connecting to sensors.
> 
> The point of Tessel Reach is to enable low-power internet-connected devices to be programmed in high-level languages - an extension of Tessel into the low-power realm, and a sensible/accessible way to connect many distributed sensor nodes to form a sensor ecosystem.
> 
> Tessel and Reach form star network whose origin is Tessel and points are Reach modules. The Tessel 2 is the entry point for the programmer.
>
> Reach modules are low-power sensor nodes placed around a room or environment.
